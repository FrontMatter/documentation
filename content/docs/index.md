# Introduction

## Overview

Are you tired of managing your markdown articles manually? Do you want to simplify
the process of content creation and management? Look no further than the Front Matter
extension for Visual Studio Code.

Designed for developers and content creators, Front Matter gives you the power and
control of a full-blown CMS, without the hassle of dealing with servers, websites, or APIs.
With Front Matter, you can create and manage your content directly in Visual Studio Code,
using your favorite tools and workflows.

The extension supports several static-site generators and frameworks, including
Astro, Hugo, Jekyll, Hexo, NextJs, Gatsby, and more.

## Why Front Matter?

Initially, [Elio Struyf][03] developed the Front Matter extension when migrating from WordPress to
Hugo (static-site Generator), in order to facilitate content management.
Over time, he expanded the extension's capabilities, until it eventually evolved into a headless
CMS that runs in Visual Studio Code.

## Advantages

We believe that Front Matter gives you the subsequent advantages:

### Speed

It simply runs on your machine. There are no servers/websites/APIs involved in the process. Nothing
can beat this.

### Use it within Visual Studio Code

Don't jump from tool to tool. Use the tool that you like the most: of course, that's Visual Studio
Code.

### Customizable

Almost all of the Front Matter features are customizable in its settings. These settings ensure that
you can tweak Front Matter to your needs.

### Extensibility

We recognize that each website is different. That is why you can upload your custom scripts. These
scripts will display as actions in the Front Matter panel and take your content material control to
the next level.
