# Astro Configuration

Astro is the all-in-one web framework designed for speed. Pull your content from anywhere
and deploy everywhere, all powered by your favorite UI components and libraries.

Front Matter CMS is a great companion to Astro and we added a
start guide on the Astro documentation site: [Front Matter CMS & Astro][01].
