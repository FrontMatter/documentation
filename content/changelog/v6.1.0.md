## New block field
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD041-->
A new field type got introduced called: `block`. The block field type allows you to define a group of fields which can be used to create a list of data. In most cases, you will use this field type to create a data list that your Static-Site Generator can use to render the content.

## Activity bar icon

The Front Matter icon got updated to show the `FM` logo, instead of the full logo for better visibility.

## Keep state of collapsible sections in the Front Matter panel

Logic of the collapsible sections in the Front Matter panel got updated to keep the state of the sections in the panel. Next time you open the panel, it will remember which sections are open/closed.

## Taxonomy limit property

The `tags`, `categories`, and `taxonomy` field types got a new property called `limit`. This property allows you to limit the number of items that can be selected in the field.

## Extra media placeholders for your media snippets

Besides the `{mediaUrl}`, `{caption}`, `{alt}`, and `{filename}`. You will now also have access to the `{mediaHeight}`, and `{mediaWidth}` placeholders for your media snippets.
