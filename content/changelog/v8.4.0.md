## üß™ Experimental features

In this release, the following features are marked as experimental. This means that they are not fully tested and might not work as expected. If you find any issues, please let me know in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/estruyf/vscode-front-matter/issues).

- External UI script support for dashboards
- Visual Studio Code Theming support for the dashboards
- Front matter AI to help you with your configuration

> **Info**: To enable the experimental features you need to set the `frontMatter.experimental` setting to `true`.

## üôè Exclusive Features for Sponsors

We're excited to announce a brand new feature exclusively available to sponsors of Front Matter CMS. With this update, we've added Front Matter AI to the project, which provides helpful suggestions for creating new content such as title suggestions and tag/category suggestions.

> **Important**: To access the Front Matter AI feature, you will need to sign-in ([backers & supports sign-in instructions](/docs/getting-started#backers-&-sponsors)) and set the `frontMatter.sponsors.ai.enabled` setting to `true` and you're good to go! We put it behind a setting to not automatically enable it and let you decide if you want to use it or not.

![Front Matter AI - Title suggestions](/releases/v8.4.0/front-matter-ai-suggestions.png)

If you're not already a sponsor, now is a great time to consider supporting the project. By becoming a sponsor, you not only gain access to exclusive features like Front Matter AI, but also help to support the ongoing development and maintenance of the project. You can become a sponsor by visiting the [GitHub sponsor page](https://github.com/sponsors/estruyf).

> More information can be found in the [sponsor features documentation](/docs/sponsor-features).

## UI extensibility

In this release, we've added support for UI extensibility. This means that you can now extend the UI of the Front Matter CMS with your own custom elements and components. This can be done in the content dashboard and the panel.

It allows you to register your own JavaScript file, to override or enrich the UI on the following places:

- Content dashboard
  - Card image
  - Card footer

- Panel
  - Custom panel view
  - Custom fields

![Custom card footer](/releases/v8.4.0/custom-card-footer.png)

> More information can be found in the [UI extensibility documentation](/docs/experimental/ui-extensibility).

## Getting help from our AI assistant

AI is hot these days, so we couldn't resist to add some AI to Front Matter CMS where it would make most sense for our users. That is why we added a chatbot which is integrated with OpenAI and our documentation. When you have a question about Front Matter CMS, you can now ask the chatbot and it will try to answer your question and/or give references to the documentation.

![Front Matter AI Assistent](/releases/v8.4.0/front-matter-ai-assistent.png)

> More information can be found in the [Front Matter AI documentation](/docs/getting-started#front-matter-ai-assistant).

> **Important**: This AI feature is available for everyone using Front Matter CMS.

## Support to manage multiple projects

With the new `frontMatter.projects` setting, we now support managing multiple projects in the same workspace. This means that you can now have multiple projects/websites, and each of them can have their own configuration.

```json {{ "title": "Example project configuration", "description": "" }}
{
  "frontMatter.projects": [
    {
      "name": "blog",
      "default": true,
      "configuration": {
        "frontMatter.content.pageFolders": [{
          "title": "Blog posts",
          "path": "[[workspace]]/websites/blog/posts"
        }],
        "frontMatter.content.publicFolder": "[[workspace]]/websites/blog/public"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "portfolio",
      "configuration": {
        "frontMatter.content.pageFolders": [{
          "title": "Portfolio",
          "path": "[[workspace]]/websites/portfolio/content"
        }],
        "frontMatter.content.publicFolder": "[[workspace]]/websites/portfolio/public"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

When you are using the projects feature, you'll be able to switch between projects using the `Front Matter: Switch project` command or UI elements.

> More information can be found in the [project documentation](/docs/settings/projects).

## Multiline support for string fields in data view

In this release, we've added support for multiline strings support in the data view. This means that you can now use the `string` field type to create a multiline string by adding the `multiline` property to the field.

```json {{ "title": "Sponsor data", "description": "Example enabling multiline support" }}
{
  ...,
  "schema": {
    "title": "Sponsors",
    "type": "object",
    "required": [
      "name",
      "url"
    ],
    "properties": {
      "name": {
        "type": "string",
        "title": "Name"
      },
      "url": {
        "type": "string",
        "title": "URL"
      },
      "description": {
        "type": "string",
        "title": "Description",
        "multiline": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> More information can be found in the [data view documentation](/docs/dashboard/datafiles-view#defining-a-data-schema).

## Support for Astro

We're thrilled to announce that Front Matter CMS now supports [Astro](https://astro.build/) projects! With this update, when you initialize a new project that uses Astro, Front Matter CMS will automatically detect it. This means that you can now easily manage your Astro content using Front Matter CMS. Enjoy!

## The frontmatter.json file now allows comments

In this release, we added a `jsonc` file association for the `frontmatter.json` and all JSON files which you might have in the `.frontmatter/config` folder. This means that you can use comments without getting any warnings from Visual Studio Code.

## Git submodule support

If you are managing your content using Git submodules, you can now use the new Git submodule settings to gain more control over the syncing process.

We've added the following settings:

| Setting | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `frontMatter.git.submodule.push` | Whether to push the submodule changes to the remote repository. | `false` |
| `frontMatter.git.submodule.pull` | Whether to pull the submodule changes from the remote repository. | `false` |
| `frontMatter.git.submodule.branch` | The branch to use for the submodule. | `` |
| `frontMatter.git.submodule.folder` | The folder where the submodule is located. | `` |

> More information can be found in the [Git submodule documentation](/docs/git-integration#git-submodules).
