# Improved welcome experience

The improved welcome experience comes with more known static-site generators and the option to register your content folders.

## New content type actions

Making it easier for the user to create content types is what we improved as well. Now underneath the metadata panel section, you will see new actions to create, update, or set a content type when the types do not match.

> **Important**: The content type creation is done based on the front matter of the current file. It might be you still have to tweak it a bit.

## WYSIWYG option for the string/text field

A new property has been added to allow to define the field as a WYSIWYG editor.
