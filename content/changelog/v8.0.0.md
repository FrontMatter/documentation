# Taxonomy dashboard

The taxonomy view is a powerful way to manage your taxonomy like categories, tags, or any other taxonomy.

On the taxonomy view, you can create, edit, delete, and move taxonomy terms from one type to another.

> **Info**: Read more about it in the [taxonomy view](/docs/dashboard#taxonomy-view) section.

## List field

The new `list` field can be used to add multiple text values. For instance, if you want to create page aliases, this field can be used.

> **Info**: Read more about it in the [list field](/docs/content-creation/fields#list) section.

## Slug field

Previously, from the actions section in the Front Matter panel, you had the option to generate/update the slug of the page. In this version, we have introduced a new `slug` field type which allows you to make changes to the slug or let Front Matter update it.

> **Info**: Read more about it in the [slug field](/docs/content-creation/fields#slug) section.

## Link a template to a content type

Since content types became the prefered option to create new content with Front Matter, we have introduced the ability to link a template to a content type. This is useful if you have some pre-defined content that you need to use in the content/pages you are creating.

> **Info**: Read more about it in the [using a template with the content type](/docs/content-creation/content-types#using-a-template-with-the-content-type) section.

## Preview path configuration property for page folders

In this version we introduced a new `previewPath` property on the page folder setting level. This property allows you to define a custom preview path for all the pages in the given folder.

![Preview path property](/releases/v8.0.0/preview-path-changelog.png)

With this change, you can now define the preview path on three levels: globally, on page folder level, and on content type level.

## Media dashboard improvements

The media dashboard has been improved to group the folders/files by their type and parent folder.
