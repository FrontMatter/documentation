## Localization of Front Matter CMS

Now both the webviews and the extension dialogs, messages, and notifications are localized. Currently we support the following languages:

- German
- Spanish
- French
- Italian
- Japanese
- Korean
- Portuguese (Brazil)
- English

> **Important**: If a human translation is not available for the language, it will be translated using Azure Translation Services. This means that the translation might not be 100% accurate. In case you want to help us translate Front Matter CMS to your language, please check out the [localization documentation](/docs/contributing#translating-the-extension).

## Custom script enhancements

With the [@frontmatter/extensibility](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@frontmatter/extensibility) package, it is easier to create custom scripts for Front Matter CMS and it allows you to do more like asking questions to the user.

### Getting the arguments

Previously, you had to manually parse the arguments from the `process.argv` array. Now you can use the `getArguments` function from the `@frontmatter/extensibility` package.

```ts
import { ContentScript, MediaScript } from '@frontmatter/extensibility';

// In content scripts
const contentScriptArgs = ContentScript.getArguments();

// In media scripts
const mediaScriptArgs = MediaScript.getArguments();
```

> **Info**: More information can be found in the [creating a content script](/docs/custom-actions#creating-a-content-script) and [creating a media script](/docs/custom-actions#creating-a-media-script) documentation.

### Asking questions

You can now ask questions to the user when running a script. This can be done by using the `askQuestion` function from the `@frontmatter/extensibility` package.

```ts
import { MediaScript } from '@frontmatter/extensibility';

const mediaScriptArgs = MediaScript.getArguments();

const answers = mediaScriptArgs.answers;
if (!answers) {
  MediaScript.askQuestions([{
    name: "width",
    message: "What is the width of the image?",
    default: image.width
  }]);
  return;
}

const width = answers.width;

// Do something with the width
```

> **Info**: More information can be found in the [asking questions to users](/docs/custom-actions#asking-questions-to-users) documentation.

## Scheduled content

You can now filter and group the content dashboard by scheduled content. This allows you to see which content is scheduled to be published in the future.

## Creating sub-content

When creating sub-content, you can now select the parent folder. This allows you to create you content in any folder you want.

You can enable this feature on the content type by setting the `allowAsSubContent` or `isSubContent` property to `true`.

> **Info**: More information can be found in the [creating sub-content](/docs/content-creation/content-types#creating-sub-content) documentation.

## Content type name shown in the panel

A small enhancement which we added in this release to the editor panel is the content type name in the metadata section. Now you can easily see which content type your content is using.
