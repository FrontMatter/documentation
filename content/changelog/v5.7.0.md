All the controls can be found on the top right of the opened file title bar.

Currently supported are:

- Headings
- Bold
- Italic
- Strikethrough
- Block quote
- Code snippet
- Code block
- Ordered list
- Unordered list
- Task list

Find out more about the `WYSIWYG` control at the [WYSIWYG section](/docs/markdown#wysiwyg) of the markdown page.

## Diagnostic output

When you encounter an issue, you will now be able to use the `Diagnostic logging` command in order to get an overview of the current state of your project. Over time, this diagnostic output will be improved and more information will be added.

## Markdown file extension support

Besides the `.md` and `.mdx`, the Front Matter now supports files with the `.markdown` extension as well.
