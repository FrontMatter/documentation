## Media dashboard redesigned + additional features

The media dashboard has been redesigned to have better folder support. It now allows you to navigate through all your folders, go back to the previous one via the breadcrumb, create new folders, and more.

### Metadata support for media files

You are now able to add your own metadata to the media files. This functionality comes in handy when you use it in combination with a snippet to insert your media files. More information at: [media view](/docs/dashboard#media-view).

## Content Type Enhancements

### Create new content by available content types

In this release you will now be able to create new content by the available content types or template.

It is available from the command palette:

![Create content by content type or template](/releases/v5.0.0/create-content.png)

and from the dashboard:

### Singleline of text support in the string field

The content type its `string` fields now support you to set the field to behave as a singleline of text input.

```
{
  "name": "title",
  "type": "string",
  "single": true
}
```

> **Info**: Find out more of the choice improvements at the [supported field types](/docs/content-creation/fields#supported-field-types) section.

### Multi-select support for image fields

Image fields can now also be used to select multiple images. This improvement allows you to add for instance product images quickly to the current content/markdown page.

## Support for workspaces with multiple folders

As some of you are using workspaces with multiple folders. Front Matter will now first validate each folder and find out in which it needs to be enabled. If it cannot decide which one to take, it will ask you.
