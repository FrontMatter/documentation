## Conditional UI for content-type fields

You can now define conditional UI for your content-type fields. This means that you can now show/hide fields based on the value of another field.

> **Info**: You can find more information about this feature in the [Field conditions](/docs/content-creation/field-conditions) documentation.

## Splitting the frontmatter.json file in multiple files

You can now split the `frontmatter.json` file in multiple files in order to keep it more manageable. This is especially useful when you have a lot of content types and/or fields.

> **Info**: You can find more information about this feature in the [Splitting the frontmatter.json file](/docs/settings#splitting-your-settings-in-multiple-files) documentation.

## More configuration options for content folders

The `frontMatter.content.pageFolders` setting has two new properties which can be defined per content folder:

- `filePrefix`: The prefix to use for the file name. By default, it's set to `yyyy-MM-dd`.
- `contentTypes`: The content types to use for the content folder. By default, all content types are allowed.

> **Info**: Check out the [frontMatter.content.pageFolders](/docs/settings/overview#frontMatter.content.pagefolders) setting for more information.

## Single line data files

Single data entry files are now supported. This means that you can now have a data file that contains a single entry, instead of an array of entries.

> **Info**: For more info, check out the [Data files](/doc/dashboard/datafiles-view#creating-a-data-file) documentation.

## Improved UX for inserting media files to your content

While inserting media files to your content, there is now a new on hover effect to indicate that you can insert the file.

## Search through your snippets

You can now search through your snippets in the snippets dashboard. This is especially useful when you have a lot of snippets.

## Git syncing improvements

We've added a few improvements to the git syncing feature:

- Deleted files are now removed from the git repository
- Ability to use placeholders on the commit message

> **Info**: You can find more information about this feature in the [Git syncing](/docs/git-integration#change-the-commit-message) documentation.

## Optimizing the content dashboard load

The content dashboard is now much faster to load. We've optimized the way we load the content by using pre-processing, caching, pagination, and more.

You can now use the `frontMatter.dashboard.content.pagination` to specify the number of items per page. By default, it's set to `16`, you can still disable it by setting it to `false`.

## Hexo support

In this version, we have added support for Hexo. You are now able to choose Hexo from the framework list during configuration.

Front Matter also supports Hexo's [asset folders](https://hexo.io/docs/asset-folders).

> **Info**: Check out the [frontMatter.content.publicFolder](/docs/settings/overview#frontmatter.content.publicfolder) setting for more information.
