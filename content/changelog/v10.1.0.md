## Command bar for contents and media dashboard

We have added a new command bar to the contents and media dashboard. This command bar allows you to perform common actions for single and multiple items.

### Common actions on cards

Besides the new command bar, the common actions on content and media cards have been updated. You can now find these actions at the bottom of the card.

## Support for glob patterns in the page folder paths

You can now use glob patterns in the page folder paths. This allows you to define a folder path that matches multiple folders.

```json {{ "title": "Example of the content folders configuration" }}
{
  "frontMatter.content.pageFolders": [
    {
      "title": "Docs",
      "path": "[[workspace]]/content/**/docs"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Extensibility enhancements

### Open a file or webpage from a custom script

With version `0.0.15` of the [@frontmatter/extensibility](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@frontmatter/extensibility) it is now possible to open a file or webpage when a custom script is completed.

```typescript
import { ContentScript } from "@frontmatter/extensibility";

ContentScript.open(`<path to a file>`);
ContentScript.open(`<URL of a webpage>`);
```

### Always show the custom panel view

The custom panel view will now always be shown, not only when content is opened. This can be useful for showing some general information about your website.
