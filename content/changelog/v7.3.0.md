# Custom actions enhancements

Custom actions now allow you to define the command to use for your script execution. This new command property, allows you to use any type of scripts like: Node.js, Python, Bash, etc.

Besides this change, you can now let Front Matter update the metadata/front matter of your content files straight from your script. All you need to do is pass the data in the right format to Front Matter, and the CMS will do the rest.

> **Info**: Read more about it in the [Custom actions](/docs/custom-actions) section.

## New dataFile field

In this version, we are introducing the new `dataFile` field. The field works like a choice field, but instead of having a predefined list of options, you set a reference to a data file that contains the options.

## Enhanced Jekyll support

In Jekyll, you typically put an article in draft by creating the file in the `_drafts` folder, and then publishing it by moving the file to the `_posts` folder.

We have added support to show the draft/published status on our content dashboard based on these two folders in this release. You don't need to use the draft field in your article's front matter anymore.

Make sure to set the `frontMatter.framework.id` setting to `jekyll` to make use of this feature.

## Publish field instead of draft

By default, Front Matter uses a `draft` field to indicate if an article is published or not. In case you want to invert this behaviour and use a `publish` field instead you will now have the ability to do so. We have added an `invert` property to the `frontMatter.content.draftField` setting. This will invert the `draft` field to `publish` and vice versa.

Example:

```json
{
  "frontMatter.taxonomy.contentTypes": [{
    "name": "My Content Type",
    "fields": [
      ...
      {
        "title": "Published",
        "name": "published",
        "type": "draft"
      },
      ...
    ]
  }]
},
{
  "frontMatter.content.draftField": {
    "name": "published",
    "type": "boolean",
    "invert": true
  }
}
```

## Automatically detecting the type of front matter

Front Matter will now automatically detect the type of front matter you are using in your content files. This functionality allows you to mix the front matter data types like YAML, TOML, or JSON format.

Depending on the type of front matter, Front Matter will parse and update the data accordingly.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Templates will be disabled

Since we introduced Content Types in Front Matter, the template functionality became less important. That is why we added a new setting `frontMatter.templates.enabled` to enable/disable the template functionality. In case of updating the extension to the new version, it will try to detect if you are using the templates functionality. If you are, Front Matter will ask if you want to keep it enabled.

On project initialization, the extension will not create the `.frontmatter/templates` folder. In case you want to use the templates functionality, you will have to manually create the folder, or run the `Front matter: Initialize the template folder` command.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecated

In this vesion, we deprecated the `frontMatter.dashboard.mediaSnippet` setting in favour of the `frontMatter.content.snippets` setting.

The new setting allows you to define and use multiple media snippets for you media files. Where the old setting only allowed one.

Check out the [media snippets](/docs/snippets#media-snippets) documentation for more information.
