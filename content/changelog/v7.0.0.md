# ‚úÇÔ∏è Snippets

A snippet is code, markup, text that you can save and reuse, and Front Matter now gives you the ability to create and manage snippets. The snippets functionality is a great way to reuse some code you have written and don't want to write again and again, but it will help you and help your editors.

## üìÖ Datetime field properties

The `frontMatter.taxonomy.dateField` and `frontMatter.taxonomy.modifiedField` settings have been deprecated and are replaced with the `isPublishDate` and `isModifiedDate` datetime field properties.

We made a guide available to migrate from the old settings to the new properties. Read more in the [publish and modified date migration](/docs/troubleshooting#publish-and-modified-date-migration) section.

## üí¨ Slide over panel

A new slide-over panel got introduced, which replaces the modal dialog. You can now see more information about the current media file in the new panel.

## üôà Hiding media files of content folder

When you are not using [page bundles](/docs/content-creation/additional-config#page-and-leaf-bundles), you might notice that you now can only insert media files from the public folder. The media files within the content folder are excluded.

Only for content types that are `pageBundle` enabled, the dashboard will show media files from the public and content folder.

## üìï Documentation updates

Updates to the **content creation** section of the documentation which now includes all the types of fields Front Matter supports. Each field type is explained in detail with a configuration and outcome details.
