## Select all button works while navigating through pages

The `select all` button now works while navigating through pages. This means that if you have a selection present and you navigate to another page, you can still use the `select all` button or select individual articles.

## Dynamic evaluation of the node executable path

The extension now dynamically tries to evaluate the `node` executable path. The extension tries to load the terminal profile which can be configured in one of the following settings:

- `terminal.integrated.automationProfile.<platform>`
- `terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.<platform>`
- `terminal.integrated.profiles.<platform>`
- `terminal.integrated.shell.<platform>`

If the terminal profile is not found, the extension will use the default `node` executable path.

## Hide WYSIWYG actions when the file is in git diff mode

The WYSIWYG actions are now hidden when the file is in git diff mode. We have added this change so that you can make use of the git diff actions that VS Code provides.
