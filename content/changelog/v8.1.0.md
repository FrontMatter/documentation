## Simple git integration

Are you using git to manage your content? If so, then we have great news for you! We have added a simple git integration that will allow you to sync your changes from and to your git repository.

![Sync your changes with GIT](/releases/v8.1.0/git-integration.png)

To enable this feature, you will need to set the `frontMatter.git.enabled` setting to `true`. The commit message can be customized via the `frontMatter.git.commitMessage` setting (default is `Synced by Front Matter`).

> **More info**: You can find more information about this feature in the [Git integration](/docs/git-integration) section.

## Dynamic placeholders

In this version we introduced a new type of custom placeholders. These are called dynamic placeholders and allow you to use custom scripts in order to generate the placeholder value.

```json
{
  "frontMatter.taxonomy.contentTypes": [
    {
      "name": "test",
      "pageBundle": false,
      "fields": [
        ...
        {
          "title": "Random",
          "name": "random",
          "type": "string",
          "default": "{{uniqueId}}-{{slug}}"
        },
        ...
      ]
    }
  ],
  "frontMatter.content.placeholders": [
    {
      "id": "uniqueId",
      "script": "./scripts/uniqueId.js",
      "command": "~/.nvm/versions/node/v16.13.1/bin/node"
    }
  ]
}
```

> **More info**: You can find more information about this feature in the [Dynamic placeholders](/docs/content-creation/placeholders#dynamic-placeholders) section.

## Post processing script

As dynamic placeholders have the limitation that you do not have access to all front matter (as the creation is still processing), we've added a new post processing script functionality. This functionality allow you to automatically run a script once the content has been created.

The post processing script has to be configured on your content-type with the `id` of the content script to use:

```json
{
  "frontMatter.taxonomy.contentTypes": [
    {
      "name": "default",
      "pageBundle": false,
      "template": "[[workspace]]/.frontmatter/templates/article.md",
      "fields": [...],
      "postScript": "generate-social-image"
    }
  ],
  "frontMatter.custom.scripts": [
    {
      "id": "generate-social-image",
      "title": "Generate social image",
      "script": "./scripts/social-img.js",
    }
  ]
}
```

> **More info**: You can find more information about this feature in the [Post processing script](/docs/content-creation/content-types#run-a-script-after-your-content-is-created) section.

## Pagination for the content dashboard

In this version we've added pagination to the content dashboard. This will allow you to navigate through your content in a more efficient way.

![Content pagination](/releases/v8.1.0/content-pagination.png)

If you want, you can disable this feature by setting the `frontMatter.dashboard.content.pagination` setting to `false`.

> **More info**: You can find more information about this feature in the [content dashboard](/docs/dashboard#content-pagination) section.

## Hide front matter from the content editing

You were already able to collapse the front matter in the editing experience, but now you can also hide it completely. This will allow you to focus on the content itself and manage the metadata within the panel.

![Hide front matter from the content](/releases/v8.1.0/hide-fm.png)

> **More info**: You can find more information about this feature in the [hiding front matter](/docs/markdown#hiding-front-matter) section.

## Start and stop server command

Starting your local server was already possible with Front Matter, but in this release, we've added a way to stop the server as well.

![Stop the server action](/releases/v8.1.0/stop-server-action.png)

## Fields support for media snippets

In previous versions, the media snippets only allowed you to use the predefined media placeholders like: `mediaUrl`, `mediaHeight`, ... etc. In this release, we've added the possibility to add custom fields to the media snippets like you can do with the content snippets.

> **More info**: You can read more about it in the [media snippets fields](/docs/snippets#fields) documentation section.

## New field properties for description and required

You'll now be able to define a description for a field and if it's required or not. You can do this with the new `description` and `required` properties.

```json
{
  "name": "title",
  "Title": "Title",
  "description": "The title of the content",
  "required": true
}
```

> **More info**: You can read more about it in the [fields properties](/docs/content-creation/fields#standard-field-properties) documentation section.

## WYSIWYG got a new hyperlink option

When editing your content, you can now easily add a hyperlink from the WYSIWYG controls.
