## Added open in VS Code button to the documentation

Inside the documentation, we have added a new button to open certain areas from Front Matter CMS directly in VS Code. This helps you to quickly navigate to the right place in your project.

## Select all media and content items in current view

In the content and media dashboards, we have added a new button to select all items in the current view. This makes it easier to perform bulk actions on multiple items.

## Extensibility: Ability to copy metadata or delete media files

Our extensibility library has been extended with new actions which allow you to copy metadata or delete media files. This can be useful when you want to perform certain actions like for example convert a meda file to a different format and keep the metadata.

New actions:

- `MediaScript.copyMetadata(source, destination)`
- `MediaScript.copyMetadataAndDelete(source, destination)`
- `MediaScript.delete(source)`
