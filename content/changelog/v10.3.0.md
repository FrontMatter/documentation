## GitHub Copilot integration

In the July 2024 release of Visual Studio Code, extension developers are able to make use of the GitHub Copilot's Large Language Model (LLM). Front Matter CMS took advantage of this feature to provide you with the ability to provide title, description, and taxonomy suggestions.

> **Important**: This feature is only available when you have the GitHub Copilot extension installed and a valid license.

For example, when creating new content when you have the GitHub Copilot extension installed, you will get title suggestions based on the provided title.

For descriptions and tags, you will get a new field action button which allows you to generate suggestions based on the content.

> **Info**: You can find more information about the GitHub Copilot integration in the [AI features](/docs/ai-features) documentation.

## Added open in VS Code button to the documentation

Inside the documentation, we have added a new button to open certain areas from Front Matter CMS directly in VS Code. This helps you to quickly navigate to the right place in your project.

## Select all media and content items in current view

In the content and media dashboards, we have added a new button to select all items in the current view. This makes it easier to perform bulk actions on multiple items.

## Extensibility

### UI extensibility is now generally available

The UI extensibility feature is now generally available, which means you do not have to toggle the `frontMatter.experimental` setting anymore.

> **Info**: You can find more information about UI extensibility in the [UI extensibility](/docs/ui-extensibility) documentation.

### Field actions

You can now link custom actions to fields which allows you to populate a field with a value by executing a custom script.

> **Info**: You can find more information about field actions in the [field actions](/docs/content-creation/field-actions) documentation.

### Ability to copy metadata or delete media files

Our extensibility library has been extended with new actions which allow you to copy metadata or delete media files. This can be useful when you want to perform certain actions like for example convert a meda file to a different format and keep the metadata.

New actions:

- `MediaScript.copyMetadata(source, destination)`
- `MediaScript.copyMetadataAndDelete(source, destination)`
- `MediaScript.delete(source)`

> **Info**: You can find more information about these actions in the [media scripts](/docs/custom-actions/media-scripts) documentation.

## Documentation and API updates

As Vercel recently stoped its support for open-source projects, we had to move our documentation and API to different hosts.

The documentation is now hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and the API is hosted on Azure Functions.

> **Important**: Get in touch with us if you have any issues accessing the documentation or the API.
