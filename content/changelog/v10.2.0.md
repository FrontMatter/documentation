## Logging improvements

In this release, we have added a new setting `frontMatter.logging` which allows you to define the logging output. The options are `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `verbose`. The default is `info`.

We also added some colors to highlight the different logging levels in the Front Matter CMS output.

## Snippet card actions

Similar to the previous release, we have added common actions at the bottom of the snippet cards. This allows you to perform actions on the snippets without having to open the snippet menu.

## Snippets dialog is now a slide-over

The snippets dialog has been updated to be a slide-over dialog. This makes it easier to work with longer snippet forms.

## Hiding the data sidebar when editing data files

When you are editing a data file, the data sidebar will now be hidden. This allows you to focus on the data file you are editing. Additionally, a dropdown of data files is shown, allowing you to switch between data files.

## Enhance multilingual support by adding the locale placeholder

We have added a new placeholder `{{locale}}` which can be used in the `previewPath` property. This allows you to generate different preview URLs based on the locale of the content.

```json {{ "title": "Example: Use the locale in your preview path" }}
"frontMatter.content.pageFolders": [
  {
    "title": "docs",
    "path": "[[workspace]]/src/content/docs",
    "previewPath": "/{{locale|ignore:en}}",
    "trailingSlash": true,
    "contentTypes": ["blog"]
  }
]
```

The preview path will generate the following path for English content: `/<slug>/`. For other locales, the preview path will generate the following path: `/<locale>/<slug>/` (e.g. `/nl/<slug>/`).

> **Info**: You can read more about the `{{locale}}` placeholder in the [special placeholders](/docs/content-creation/placeholders#example-5-using-the-locale-placeholder) section.

## Added support for trailing slashes in the preview path

You can now define whether you want to have trailing slashes in the preview path. This can be done by setting the `trailingSlash` property to `true` or `false`. The setting can be defined on global, content folder, and content type levels.

```json {{ "title": "Example: Use trailing slashes in the preview path" }}
{
  "frontMatter.preview.trailingSlash": true
}
```
